# Guide

This guide and codebase is a companion resource for those reading [On the Building Blocks of Mathematical Logic](https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2020/12/Schonfinkel-OnTheBuildingBlocksOfMathematicalLogic.pdf) by [Moses Sch√∂nfinkel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Sch%C3%B6nfinkel).

The guide annotates the paper section-by-section. I only quote directly from the paper when there is something to call out explicitly. When possible I bias towards a fully working implementation in code that the reader can use themselves.
